Seamlessly integrate WooCommerce with Gift-i-Card service to automate gift card ordering, real-time status tracking, and instant customer delivery.

== Description ==
Gift-i-Card seamlessly connects WooCommerce with the Gifticard.pro service, enabling global gift card sales and automated fulfillment.

**Main Features and Operations:**
- **Support for Simple and Variable WooCommerce Products:**
  - The plugin fully supports mapping both simple and variable WooCommerce products (including product variations) to Gift-i-Card variants.
- **Connection Status & Real-Time Wallet Balance:**
  - Admins can view the current connection status to the Gift-i-Card API and see the real-time balance of their Gift-i-Card wallet directly from the plugin dashboard.
- **Product Mapping:**
  - Map each WooCommerce product or variation to a specific Gift-i-Card variant using the admin panel.
  - Mapping is managed via AJAX and stored in product meta fields, allowing you to sell exact gift card types from your WooCommerce catalog.
  - The mapping interface supports searching WooCommerce products and linking them to Gift-i-Card variants.
- **Product Status Synchronization:**
  - Automatically synchronize Gift-i-Card product availability status with WooCommerce stock status.
  - Configurable status mapping for different Gift-i-Card delivery types (Instant, Manual, Out of Stock, Deleted/Not Available).
  - Scheduled synchronization via WordPress cron jobs (recommended: 2-3 times daily).
  - Manual synchronization option for immediate updates.
  - Real-time status display showing next execution time and current sync status.
  - Automatic stock status updates based on Gift-i-Card inventory changes.
- **Automatic Gift Card Order Placement:**
  - When a customer places an order containing mapped products, the plugin automatically sends a purchase request to the Gift-i-Card API for each mapped item.
  - The plugin handles the API response, stores the Gift-i-Card order details (including codes) in the WooCommerce order meta, and adds order notes for tracking.
- **Order Status Automation:**
  - The plugin monitors the status of Gift-i-Card orders (via API and webhook).
  - If all mapped items are successfully fulfilled, the WooCommerce order status is automatically set to “completed.”
  - If any mapped item fails, the order status can be set to “failed” (configurable).
  - Status updates are handled both by scheduled checks (cron) and real-time webhook notifications from Gift-i-Card.
  - The plugin can automatically set WooCommerce order status to "cancelled" when required (auto-cancellation).
- **Display of Purchased Gift Cards:**
  - The purchased gift card codes and related information (serial, card code, redeem link, expiration date, etc.) are displayed to the customer:
    - In the order confirmation email
    - On the order details page in the user account
    - On the “Thank You” page after payment
  - The display is dynamic and only shown for items mapped to Gift-i-Card variants.
- **Admin Sync and Management:**
  - Admins can sync categories, products, and variants from the Gift-i-Card API to WordPress for easier mapping and management.
  - There are tools for bulk deletion of plugin data and for manual order management.

**Compatibility:**
- Fully compatible with both HPOS (High-Performance Order Storage) and the legacy WooCommerce order storage system
